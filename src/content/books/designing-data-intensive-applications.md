Currently working through this comprehensive guide to modern data systems. Essential reading for understanding how large-scale applications handle data.

## Progress

Currently on Chapter 5: Replication

## Why I'm Reading This

As I work more with distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, understanding the fundamentals of data storage, retrieval, and processing becomes critical. This book bridges the gap between theory and practice.

## Notes So Far

- The trade-offs between different database paradigms (relational, document, graph)
- How encoding formats affect system evolution
- The importance of understanding failure modes in distributed systems
