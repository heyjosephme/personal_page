A classic that every developer should read. This book changed how I think about writing code and building software.

## Key Takeaways

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation
- **Tracer Bullets** - Use small experiments to validate assumptions quickly
- **Broken Windows** - Don't leave bad code to rot; fix it or board it up immediately

## Favorite Quotes

> "You Can't Write Perfect Software. Did that hurt? It shouldn't."

> "Care About Your Craft. Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?"

This book reinforced my belief that programming is a craft, not just a job.
