Recently, a friend suggested me an infrastructure engineering role, 
and it resonated with me. As a full-stack developer, I've always been curious about how applications scale
and run in production. This suggestion came at the perfect time, and I've decided to take the leap into 
DevOps and infrastructure.

## Why Infrastructure Engineering?

Infrastructure engineering offers a perfect blend of development and operations. It's an opportunity to:

- Deepen my understanding of how applications run at scale
- Work with cutting-edge cloud technologies
- Broaden my impact on system reliability and performance
- Challenge myself with new technologies and concepts

## My Learning Path

I've mapped out a focused learning approach:

1. **Google Cloud DevOps Professional Path**
   - Complete the Google Cloud DevOps learning path
   - Focus on practical implementations
   - Build hands-on experience with GCP services

2. **Kubernetes Certification (CKA)**
   - Study the CKA guide thoroughly
   - Practice with real-world scenarios
   - Master container orchestration concepts

## Goals

I've set two concrete certification goals:
1. Pass the Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer certification
2. Obtain the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification

These certifications will not just be badges - they'll validate my practical knowledge and readiness for infrastructure roles.

## Next Steps

Starting today, I'm diving into the Google Cloud DevOps learning path. I'll be documenting my journey, sharing insights, and noting important concepts along the way.

Stay tuned for more posts about my learning experiences, challenges, and victories in this new direction!
